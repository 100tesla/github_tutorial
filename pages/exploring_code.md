For my own repositories, I like to use [gitx](http://gitx.frim.nl/) on
my Mac.

But, of course, you can also just poke around
[github](http://github.com) itself.

And you can do a lot of things from the command line, say to look at
the combined changes to a file that were made over the last year.
See the [github page about `git diff`](http://learn.github.com/p/diff.html).
