title: Why git and github?

### Why use [git](http://git-scm.com)?

_Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes_
in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects.  I
used to make numbered tar.gz files for a project.  But exploring the
differences is difficult, to say the least.  And if you use git
properly, you'll have annotated each small change.

_Merging collaborators' changes made easy._  Have you ever had to
deal with a collaborator sending you modifications distributed across
many files, or had to deal with two people having made changes to the same
file at the same time?  Painful.  `git merge` is the answer.


### Why use [github](http://github.com)?

_Github is like facebook for programmers._  Everyone's on there. You
can look at what they're working on and easily peruse their
code and make suggestions or changes.

_It's really open source._ &ldquo;Open source&rdquo; is not so open if
you can't easily study it.  With github, all of the code easily
inspected, as is its entire history.

_Github lowers the barriers to collaboration._  It's dead easy to
offer suggested changes to others' code through github.  I was able to
[fix a mistake](https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos/commit/903a5e821a54a7dc5a2695e47db3abe2517742fe)
in the
[phobos library](https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos) for
the [D programming language](http://dlang.org), because it's hosted on
github.  I
[fixed some problems](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip/commit/c0117472438db94e0cf3febd45bf768ddc1bea5c)
in some very useful code developed by someone I don't know, because
it's hosted on github.

_You don't have to set up a git server._
