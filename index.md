All statistical/computational scientists should use
[git](http://git-scm.com) and [github](http://github.com).  It can be
hard to get started.  I hope these pages help.  (More blather below.)

- [Your first time](first_time.html): get account; set up ssh
- Typical use: add, commit, push
- Start new repository: from scratch; using current project
- [Contribute to someone's repository](fork.html)
- I want to fix a bug in someone's project
- A package I'm using has a bug but I can't figure out how to fix it
- Oops; that last commit message was wrong
- Exploring what I've done
- R packages
- Markdown
- Song of github

I love git and github.  I
use both for keeping track of programming projects, papers, talks, and
data analyses.  And github has enabled me to
contribute at least minor things to others' projects, like the
[D phobos library](https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos)
and [d3-tip](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip).

I use git mostly from the command line on a Mac.  I use the github
site to explore others' code, make pull requests, and indicate issues.

I would like all of my statistical/computational collaborators to use
git and github, so that we
may collaborate more easily.  But for
statisticians with no history of use of version control, it can be
hard to get started.  This is a tutorial of sorts, to help.

[Pjotr Prins](http://www.thebird.nl) got me to move from SVN to
git, but don't hold him responsible for any
errors in my understanding.

If you have suggestions for changes or improvements, fork

instructions above, &ldquo;[Contribute to someone's repository](fork.html).&rdquo;
