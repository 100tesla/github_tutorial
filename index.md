I love [git](http://git-scm.com) and [github](http://github.com).  I
use both for keeping track of programming projects, papers, talks, and
data analyses.  And github has enabled me to contribute at least minor
things to others' projects, like the
[D phobos library](https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/phobos)
and [d3-tip](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip).

I use git mostly from the command line on a Mac.  I use the github
site to explore others' code, make pull requests, and indicate issues.

I would like all of my statistical/computational collaborators to use
git and github, so that we may share code more easily.  But for
statisticians with no history of use of version control, it can be
hard to get started.  This is a tutorial of sorts, to help them get
started.

- [Your first time](first_time.html): get account; set up ssh
- Typical use: add, commit, push
- start new repository: from scratch; using current project
- my friend wants to contribute code/changes
- I want to fix a bug in someone's project
- A package I'm using has a bug but I can't figure out how to fix it
- Oops; that last commit message was wrong
- Exploring what I've done
- Song of github
